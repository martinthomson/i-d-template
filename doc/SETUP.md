# Installation and Setup

At a minimum, you need `make` and `xml2rfc`.


## make

Mac users might need to install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) to get a version of
[`make`](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) that works properly (the version
shipped in XCode is subtly broken).

```sh
brew install make
```

Note that this installs as `gmake`.  Follow the instructions to add this as
`make` to your path.

Windows users will need to use [Cygwin](http://cygwin.org/) or [the Windows
Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)
to get `make`.


## xml2rfc

All systems require [xml2rfc](http://xml2rfc.tools.ietf.org/).  This
requires [Python 3](https://www.python.org/).  Be sure not to get Python 2,
which is no longer supported.  The easiest way to get `xml2rfc` is with
[pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/), which is either installed with
python, or part of the `python-pip` or `python3-pip` package on most
distributions.

On Cygwin, you'll need to install `pip` directly:

```sh
$ curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | python
```

Once pip is installed, you can install xml2rfc.

Using a `virtualenv`:

```sh
$ virtualenv --no-site-packages venv
# remember also to activate the virtualenv before any 'make' run
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip3 install xml2rfc
```

To your local user account:

```sh
$ pip3 install --user xml2rfc
```

Or globally (not advisable):

```sh
$ sudo pip3 install xml2rfc
```

xml2rfc might need development versions of [libxml2](http://xmlsoft.org/) and
[libxslt1](http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT).  These packages are named `libxml2-dev` and
`libxslt1-dev` (Debian, Ubuntu); `libxml2-devel` and `libxslt1-devel` (RedHat,
Fedora); or `libxml2-devel` and `libxslt-devel` (Cygwin).


## Markdown

If you use markdown, you will also need to install `kramdown-rfc2629` or `mmark`.

The template stuff tries to work out which of these you are working with based
on the first line of the file:

* `kramdown-rfc2629` files must start with '---'

* `mmark` files must start with '%%%'

## kramdown-rfc2629

[`kramdown-rfc2629`](https://github.com/cabo/kramdown-rfc2629) requires
[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) and can be installed using the Ruby package
manager, `gem`:

```sh
$ gem install kramdown-rfc2629
```


## mmark

[`mmark`](https://github.com/miekg/mmark) requires [go](https://golang.org/), and that comes with its
own complications.

```sh
cd ~/bin
go get github.com/miekg/mmark/mmark
go build github.com/miekg/mmark/mmark
```

You might want to set aside a directory for your go code other than the default,
and find a directory that is on the path where you can install `mmark`.  For
these, I set `GOPATH=~/gocode`.


## pyang

[`pyang`](https://github.com/mbj4668/pyang) is needed for markdown that uses `YANG-TREE <module.yang>` to import an external yang file.

```sh
$ pip install pyang
```


## yanglint / libyang

[`yanglint`](https://github.com/CESNET/libyang/tree/master/tools/lint) is part of the [`libyang`](https://github.com/CESNET/libyang) package.  It's required only if you're validating YANG modules with `make yanglint` or with the `VALIDATE_YANG=1` environment variable during make.

In late 2019, the libyang package is unfortunately not yet widely available as an rpm, deb, brew, etc. package in stable distros like for example the latest LTS, Bionic Beaver.  So if you're using this feature, it may be necessary to install from source.  This requires `cmake` and `libpcre3-dev`:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/CESNET/libyang.git
mkdir libyang/build
pushd libyang/build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/ ..
make
make install
popd
```
