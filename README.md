# Internet Draft Template Repository

The contents of this repository can be used to get started with a new internet
draft.

## Getting Started

You need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join).

Make your you have the [necessary software installed](https://github.com/martinthomson/i-d-template/blob/master/doc/SETUP.md).

### Working Group Setup

Make a [new organization](https://github.com/organizations/new) for your working
group.  This guide will use the name `unicorn-wg` for your working group.

See the [more detailed guide](https://github.com/martinthomson/i-d-template/blob/master/doc/WG-SETUP.md).

### New Draft Setup

[Make a new repository](https://github.com/new).  This guide will use the
name name `unicorn-protocol` here.

When prompted, select the option to initialize the repository with a README.

Clone that repository:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/unicorn-wg/unicorn-protocol.git
$ cd unicorn-protocol
```

Clone a copy of this respository into place:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/martinthomson/i-d-template lib
```

Alternatively, you can use `git submodule` to get a stable version.

Choose whether you want to use markdown, outline, or xml as your input form.
If you already have a draft, then that decision is already made for you.

Make a draft file.  The name of the file is important, make it match the name of
your draft.  You can take a copy of the [example](https://github.com/martinthomson/i-d-template/blob/master/example.md) [files](https://github.com/martinthomson/i-d-template/blob/master/example.xml) if you are starting from
scratch.

Edit the draft so that it has both a title and the correct name.  These tools
uses the `-latest` suffix in place of the usual number ('-00', or '-08').  The
number is generated automatically when you use `make submit`.

In XML, you should have something like:
```xml
<rfc docName="draft-ietf-unicorn-protocol-latest"
     ... other attributes ...>
  <front>
    <title abbrev="Unicorns!!!">The Unicorn Protocol</title>
```

Markdown is similar:
```yaml
docname: draft-ietf-unicorn-protocol-latest
title: The Unicorn Protocol
```

Now, run the setup commands:
```sh
$ make -f lib/setup.mk
```

This removes adds some files, updates `README.md` with the details of your
draft, sets up a `gh-pages` branch for your editor's copy.

__Note:__ if you see a `kramdown-rfc2629: command not found` error this is because `kramdown-rfc2629` isn't in your path. Run `gem install kramdown-rfc2629` to fix. If this command doesn't run check that you have ruby installed. 

Check that everything looks OK, then push.
```sh
$ git push
```


### Updating The Editor's Copy

You can maintain `gh-pages` manually by running the following command
occasionally.

```sh
$ make ghpages
```

Or, you can setup an automatic commit hook using Travis or Circle CI.


### Automatic Update for Editor's Copy

This requires that you sign in with [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) or
[Circle](https://circleci.com/).

First enable builds for the new repository:
[Travis](https://travis-ci.org/profile),
[Circle](https://circleci.com/add-projects).  Travis might need to be refreshed
before you can see your repository.

Then, you need to get yourself a [new GitHub application
token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new).  The application token only
needs the `public_repo` privilege.  This will let it push updates to your
`gh-pages` branch.

You can add environment variables using the Travis or Circle interface.  Include
a variable with the name `GH_TOKEN` and the value of your newly-created
application token.  On Travis, make sure to leave the value of "Display value in
build log" disabled, or you will be making your token public.

**WARNING**: You might want to use a dummy account for application tokens to
minimize the consequences of accidental leaks of your key.

Once you enable pushes, be very careful merging pull requests that alter
`.travis.yml`, `circle.yml` or `Makefile`.  Those files can cause the value of
the token to be published for all to see.  You don't want that to happen.  Even
though tokens can be revoked easily, discovering a leak might take some time.
Only pushes to the main repository will be able to see the token, so don't worry
about pull requests.

As a side benefit, Travis and Circle will now also check pull requests for
errors, letting you know if things didn't work out so that you don't merge
anything suspect.


## Updating the Support Files

Occasionally improvements and changes are made to the Makefile or the
support files in this repository.  Just update the `lib/` directory with
`git pull`:

```sh
$ git -C lib pull origin master
```


## Submitting Drafts

See the [submission guide](https://github.com/martinthomson/i-d-template/blob/master/doc/SUBMITTING.md).
